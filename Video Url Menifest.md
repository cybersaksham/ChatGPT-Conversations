To embed a YouTube video in your app, you can use the YouTube Android Player API. This API allows you to embed YouTube videos in your app and control playback.

Here are the general steps to embed a YouTube video in

I see, in order to implement the behavior where a video from your app can be watched directly within WhatsApp, you can add support for WhatsApp's rich media link preview feature.

When a user shares a link to your app's video on WhatsApp, the app can generate a rich media link preview that includes a thumbnail image of the video, along with a title and description. When the user taps on the link preview, they will be taken directly to the video within your app.

To implement this feature, you will need to add support for Open Graph metadata tags to your app's web pages or server-side code. Open Graph tags allow you to specify the title, description, and thumbnail image for each video page on your site.

Once you've added the Open Graph tags to your site, you can test the link previews by sharing a link to one of your videos on WhatsApp. If the preview doesn't appear correctly, you may need to use the WhatsApp Debugger tool to troubleshoot any issues with your Open Graph tags.

It's worth noting that this behavior is dependent on WhatsApp's implementation of rich media link previews, and may not work in all cases or on all devices. Additionally, some users may prefer to open the link in a separate browser window or within your app itself, so it's a good idea to provide options for both.

> given some example to add this

Sure, here's an example of how you can add Open Graph metadata tags to your app's video pages:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta property="og:title" content="Title of your video" />
    <meta property="og:description" content="Description of your video" />
    <meta
      property="og:image"
      content="https://example.com/video-thumbnail.jpg"
    />
    <meta property="og:url" content="https://example.com/video-page-url" />
    <meta property="og:type" content="video" />
    <meta property="og:video" content="https://example.com/video-url.mp4" />
    <meta property="og:video:type" content="video/mp4" />
    <meta property="og:video:width" content="640" />
    <meta property="og:video:height" content="360" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your video player goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, we're setting the following Open Graph tags:

- `og:title`: the title of your video
- `og:description`: a description of your video
- `og:image`: a thumbnail image for your video
- `og:url`: the URL of your video page
- `og:type`: the type of your content (in this case, `video`)
- `og:video`: the URL of your video file
- `og:video:type`: the MIME type of your video file
- `og:video:width`: the width of your video player
- `og:video:height`: the height of your video player

You should replace the example values with the actual values for your video. You can add these tags to the `head` section of your HTML document.

Once you've added the Open Graph tags, you can test the link preview by sharing the video URL on WhatsApp. If everything is set up correctly, the link preview should show the video thumbnail, title, and description, and tapping on the link should take the user directly to your app's video player.

> but my data is getting fetched from api so details of video will not be availabel immediately

---

If your app fetches video data from an API and the video details are not available immediately, you can still use Open Graph tags to generate a link preview. However, you may need to generate the Open Graph tags dynamically, once you have the video details from your API.

One approach to generating dynamic Open Graph tags is to use server-side rendering. When a user shares a link to your app's video on WhatsApp, WhatsApp will scrape the link to generate the link preview. If you include the Open Graph tags in the server-side rendered HTML, WhatsApp will be able to use those tags to generate the link preview.

Here's an example of how you could use server-side rendering to generate Open Graph tags for a video page:

1.  When a user shares a link to a video, your app should generate a server-side request to retrieve the video details from your API.
2.  Once you have the video details, you can use a server-side rendering library (such as React or Vue) to generate the HTML for the video page, including the Open Graph tags.
3.  Once the server-side rendering is complete, you can return the HTML to the client as a string.
4.  The client can then use this HTML to render the video page, and WhatsApp will be able to use the Open Graph tags in the HTML to generate the link preview.

Alternatively, you could use a client-side rendering approach, where you generate the Open Graph tags on the client side once you have the video details. In this approach, you would use JavaScript to generate the HTML for the video page and include the Open Graph tags in the HTML. However, this approach may not work as reliably as server-side rendering, since WhatsApp may not execute the JavaScript on the client side when generating the link preview.

Sure, here's an example of how you can generate Open Graph tags dynamically on the server-side using Node.js:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const fetch = require("node-fetch");
const { JSDOM } = require("jsdom");
const { renderToString } = require("react-dom/server");
const React = require("react");
const App = require("./App"); // Your React component that renders the video page

const app = express();

app.get("/videos/:videoId", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { videoId } = req.params;

    // Fetch video details from your API
    const videoDataResponse = await fetch(
      `https://your-api.com/videos/${videoId}`
    );
    const videoData = await videoDataResponse.json();

    // Generate Open Graph tags dynamically based on video data
    const ogTags = {
      title: videoData.title,
      description: videoData.description,
      image: videoData.thumbnailUrl,
      url: `https://your-app.com/videos/${videoId}`,
      type: "video",
      video: videoData.videoUrl,
      videoType: "video/mp4",
      videoWidth: 640,
      videoHeight: 360,
    };

    // Render your video page using React
    const appHtml = renderToString(<App videoData={videoData} />);

    // Create a new JSDOM instance to modify the HTML
    const dom = new JSDOM(
      `<!DOCTYPE html><html><head></head><body>${appHtml}</body></html>`
    );
    const { document } = dom.window;

    // Add Open Graph tags to the HTML
    Object.keys(ogTags).forEach((tagName) => {
      const tagValue = ogTags[tagName];
      const metaTag = document.createElement("meta");
      metaTag.setAttribute("property", `og:${tagName}`);
      metaTag.setAttribute("content", tagValue);
      document.head.appendChild(metaTag);
    });

    // Return the modified HTML to the client
    const finalHtml = dom.serialize();
    res.send(finalHtml);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).send("Error generating link preview");
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server started on port 3000");
});
```

This example uses Node.js and the `express` web framework to create a simple server that generates Open Graph tags dynamically based on video data retrieved from your API.

The server listens for requests to a route that includes a video ID parameter (`/videos/:videoId`). When a request is received, the server fetches the video data from your API and generates Open Graph tags based on the data. It then uses React to render the video page and modify the HTML with the Open Graph tags.

Once the HTML is generated, it is sent back to the client as a response to the original request.

This is just a basic example to get you started. Depending on your specific needs, you may need to modify the code to suit your app's architecture and requirements.

> implement client side

Sure, here's an example of how you can generate Open Graph tags dynamically on the client-side using JavaScript:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My Video App</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale
```

---

> implement client side in react

---

Sure, here's an example of how you can generate Open Graph tags dynamically on the client-side using React:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function VideoPage({ videoId }) {
  const [videoData, setVideoData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchVideoData() {
      const response = await fetch(`https://your-api.com/videos/${videoId}`);
      const data = await response.json();
      setVideoData(data);
    }
    fetchVideoData();
  }, [videoId]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (videoData) {
      // Generate Open Graph tags dynamically based on video data
      const ogTags = {
        title: videoData.title,
        description: videoData.description,
        image: videoData.thumbnailUrl,
        url: `https://your-app.com/videos/${videoId}`,
        type: "video",
        video: videoData.videoUrl,
        videoType: "video/mp4",
        videoWidth: 640,
        videoHeight: 360,
      };

      // Add Open Graph tags to the document head
      Object.keys(ogTags).forEach((tagName) => {
        const tagValue = ogTags[tagName];
        const metaTag = document.createElement("meta");
        metaTag.setAttribute("property", `og:${tagName}`);
        metaTag.setAttribute("content", tagValue);
        document.head.appendChild(metaTag);
      });
    }
  }, [videoData, videoId]);

  if (!videoData) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{videoData.title}</h1>
      <video src={videoData.videoUrl} width="640" height="360" controls />
      <p>{videoData.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default VideoPage;
```

This example assumes that you have a React component called `VideoPage` that renders the video page, and that you are fetching video data from an API in the `useEffect` hook.

The first `useEffect` hook fetches the video data from the API and sets it in the component state.

The second `useEffect` hook generates Open Graph tags dynamically based on the video data, and adds them to the document head. This ensures that the tags are available to WhatsApp when it scrapes the link.

Finally, the component renders the video page using the fetched video data.

Note that this approach relies on JavaScript to generate the Open Graph tags, which may not work reliably if WhatsApp does not execute JavaScript when scraping the link. In that case, you may need to use a server-side rendering approach instead.
